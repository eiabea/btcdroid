The app is only usefull if you mine in Slush's Pool! 
I started coding this monitoring app for private use, because all the other tracker try to provide as much pools as possible, but show only a few informations about this pool, so i decided to write an app only for Slush's Pool.

Personal guidelines:
.) No ads
.) Free to use
.) No tracking of userdata
